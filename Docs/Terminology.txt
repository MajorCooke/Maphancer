*** Terminology ***

	* Checksum
A string of characters ranging from 0-9 and A-Z, constructed by calculating all
the things, vertexes, lines, sides and/or sectors present within the map, giving
each a unique identifier. Changing *ANYTHING* about the map, even shifting one
thing over by a single unit will completely change the checksum, ensuring every
version of the map has a unique identifier that can be gathered and used for
specific versions.

As such, new versions of the map will never implement checksum-specific 
modifications of older versions because of this.

	* Section Chain (MHSecChain)
An established connection with an ID that manages all monsters (de)activated by
the certain events (i.e. crossing a line, or a specialized MapHancer trigger).
These are created at the start of a map. Their targeted regions for deactivating
monsters are established in ZHancerInputs.txt and processed, shutting down the 
affected within the bounding boxes/sectors established.

Once enabled, they restore functionality to the monsters before removing themselves.

	* Maphancer Trigger (MHTrigger)
A specialized map placed trigger that can be used to help section off parts of
a map. This behaves exactly how SecActEnter (Actor Enters Sector action) does,
but instead of calling a special, it directly tells the link associated by ID
to activate. Only triggers once by players. Will be expanded to include more
functionality in the future.

	* Aliases
An aliased ID means it belongs to another. Any alias that is linked to a specific
ID will also trigger as well. This is the only way to trigger multiple chains at
the same time. 

Note: If an aliased number is shared between multiple groups, those alias groups
will effectively be activated as if they're all one large group.
