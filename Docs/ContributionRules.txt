All help and contribution to the project is welcome. However, there is some
limitations as to what maps will be allowed or blacklisted.

*** RULES ***
Maps that are applicable for Maphancer must meet these criteria for submissions:
- Slaughter map (500+ monsters)
- Gets a decent boost to FPS when entering the map with "No Monsters" enabled
- Has little to no ACS/ZScript built specifically for the map
- Isn't a Mockumentary-esque map [1]

[1] - These maps fall under the ACS rule, and are designed to be as they are.

*** STANDARDS ***
For the most part these should be applied. Exceptions can be made (see 
Contributions section below):
- Latest version only [2]
- Is at least 6+ months old without further development
- Isn't a NUTS 1-esque map [3]

[2] - Old versions will be kept until the new version can be implemented
[3] - Usually features all monsters in one place that all wake up and can 
immediately attack players at once. NUTS 2 may be an exception, as half of the 
enemies are cordoned off in another section.

*** SUBMISSIONS ***
Invoked by opening an Issue in Github, please specify the name of the WAD with a
direct download link with the particular map numbers listed. All rules and standards
will be applied.

*** CONTRIBUTIONS ***
Contributors are those who make pull requests to add in maps directly to the 
input code. These have a much higher chance of being added as the contributor 
did the hard work for us. Better still, some of the standards can even be waived.
