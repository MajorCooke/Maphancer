*** How to get map checksums ***

This is important so this acts only for specific maps.

1. Load up the WAD in GZDoom.

2. In console, type "mapchecksum <levelname>", where levelname is the technical
	name, i.e. MAP29 for Doom 2 or E1M8 for Doom.
	
3. Do this for all maps in the WAD that could benefit from having monsters in
	their closets deactivated.
	
4. Once all maps have their checksums printed, do "error_fatal" in console.
	This will close the game but bring up the console and display all the prior
	commands and their results entered. 
	
5. Copy/paste these checksums into a notepad and make note of the WAD name and 
	map number.
